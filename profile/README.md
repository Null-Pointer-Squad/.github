Let's get started! and have a look at what we are trying to build! 🎉.

# E-Commerce Microservices Platform

we are simulating building an e-commerce platform using microservices architecture. We are building a platform that allows customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and purchase them and track thier shippment. We are also building a platform that allows admins to manage products, categories, brands, stors stock and coupons.

## 1. Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a standalone web-based application developed using Spring Boot that aims to streamline various banking operations. This system offers features to manage customer accounts and perform transactions. (we are using this system to simulate the payment process in our e-commerce platform)

Check out the full details here 👉🏻 [Bank Management System README file.](https://github.com/Null-Pointer-Squad/bank-management-system-springboot)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User {
        SERIAL id PK
        VARCHAR name
        VARCHAR password
        VARCHAR phone "UNIQUE"
        VARCHAR email "UNIQUE"
    }

    Account {
        SERIAL id PK
        VARCHAR card_number "UNIQUE"
        VARCHAR cvv
        DOUBLE balance
        SERIAL user_id FK
    }

    Transaction {
        SERIAL id PK
        VARCHAR type
        DOUBLE amount
        TEXT notes
        DATE timestamp
        SERIAL account_id FK
    }

    User ||--o{ Account : "has"
    Account ||--o{ Transaction : "history"
```

## 2. Admin Management and Authentication Service

This service is an admin management and authentication service built using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It provides a secure and efficient way to manage admin users, authenticate them using email and password, and generate JWTs for accessing protected resources. Additionally, admins have the ability to add other admins and activate or deactivate their accounts.
(we are using this system to simulate the admin management and authentication process in our e-commerce platform)

        VARCHAR email
        VARCHAR password
        BOOLEAN  enabled
    }

```

## 3. Product Catalog API Service

This service is built for managing a product catalog [adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving products] for an E-Commerce Application. (we are using this system to simulate the product catalog management process in our e-commerce platform)
